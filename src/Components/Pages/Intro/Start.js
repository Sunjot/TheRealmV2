        <p>Game of Thrones consists of 8 seasons, 7 of which have aired as of this writing.
        The show is an adaptation of the 7 novels in the series A Song of Ice and Fire, written
        by George R. R. Martin. Of those 7 novels, only 5 have been released so far (because
        GRRM is a cruel man), but the show itself has moved ahead. If you're wondering how,
        GRRM is also a co-executive producer for the show, and so the creators Benioff and
        Weiss know how the show will end its final few seasons (which are largely based on the last
        2 novels).</p>

          of Westeros. Almost all the action in the show takes place here. I also made a point to mention
          that this continent is split into two areas - the Seven Kingdoms and the area Beyond the Wall.
          However, it isn't that simple. We must break it down even further! I mean, it's called the Seven
          Kingdoms for a reason - it's important we go into detail on what these kingdoms actually are.
          Not only that, but what exactly lies Beyond the Wall? Not to worry, everything will be addressed!

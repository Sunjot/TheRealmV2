          Robert's Rebellion. Well - turns out - it is one of the biggest series of events in the Game of Thrones
          Universe and essential knowledge before you dive into the show. It occurs not long before beginning
          of the series and sets up the current state in Westeros. You could probably read into it a lot more
          elsewhere, but I will try to summarize the events the best I can.
